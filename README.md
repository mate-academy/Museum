The Museum landing page was created for the NAMU Museum. It contains information about current events (exhibitions) of the museum, a gallery with paintings of the museum, the opportunity to subscribe to current events of the museum and its contacts. 

The landing page was created according to [Figma design](https://www.figma.com/file/cRBCqE06cDrY3s4jX7h3iY/%D0%9D%D0%90%D0%9C%D0%A3-(Edit)?node-id=0%3A1).

When creating the landing page, i used HTML, SCSS, BEM. 

That is my [DEMO LINK](https://Teerveet.github.io/Museum/).
