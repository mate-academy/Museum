# Museum landing page

Museum landing page - [DEMO LINK](https://tania-troshchuk.github.io/Museum/)

This landing page was implemented to announce events taking place in the National Art Museum of Ukraine.

Museum landing page - this is one of my works, which I performed using knowledge of HTML, CSS, SASS, BEM, and JavaScript. The landing page was developed by implementing an adaptive layout (using a grid and flexbox).

This landing was developed according to the layout [Figma design](https://www.figma.com/file/cRBCqE06cDrY3s4jX7h3iY/%D0%9D%D0%90%D0%9C%D0%A3-(Edit)?node-id=0%3A1).

This landing page was designed according to the layout for such devices as:
- phone (with a screen width of more than 320 pixels);
- tablet (with screen width from 768 pixels to 1280 pixels);
- notebook (with a screen width of more than 1280 pixels).
